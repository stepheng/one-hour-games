# One Hour Games

Short of time, I wanted to practice rapidly prototyping and learning. To prevent over comitting myself, I've started working through the previous jams  in the [One Hour Game Jam](http://onehourgamejam.com).

These are the games. They are not intended as best practice since this is part learning, and part shipping rapidly.
